                  actually has more than one lens and what each one does, and what hidden features are already sitting inside the Camera app that
                   most people never use. You will learn how to work with light, focus, and framing, and you will see that understanding photography
                    does ***not have to be complicated***.
                     --------
                     Anyone can snap a quick photo, but once you understand how the iPhone camera thinks, your photos
                     will stand out. (Ugly friend included)`,
                  text4: `Okay, let’s clear this up once and for all: people love to say “your iPhone can’t beat a pro camera.” 
                    And sure, a $5000 DSLR with a lens the size of a baguette might win in some extreme cases… 
                    but here’s the catch: most of the time, your iPhone is already doing *pro-level tricks* for you, automatically.  
                    Computational photography (fancy word, I know) means your iPhone is actually taking multiple shots, 
                    mixing them together, balancing light and colors, and handing you the best version — in a split second. 
                    A “pro” camera? You’d have to shoot in RAW (a file format), adjust exposure, play with white balance, then edit for hours.  
                    
                   
                    
                     
                    
                    - **Telephoto Lens** (on Pro models) – this is for zooming without the potato-quality effect. 
                    It’s amazing for portraits because it naturally compresses the background, 
                    making your subject pop while keeping things looking flattering. 
                    In short: use this one when you want to take that “magazine cover” style photo of your friend.  
                    
                    So, while your DSLR friend scrolls through menus and swaps lenses, you just tap and shoot.  
                    That’s why this course exists: to show you how to actually *use* these tools, 
                    instead of just sticking with the basic camera app and hoping for the best.`,

                  text5: ` Now let’s talk lenses — because no, Apple didn’t just slap on extra glass for decoration.  
                    Each lens has its own job:
                    
                    - **Main (Wide) Lens** – this is your everyday shooter. It’s the most balanced lens, great for street photos, travel snaps, 
                    and pretty much everything. Think of it as your “default.”

                  text6: `- Ultra-Wide Lens – this one lets you capture way more in the frame. Perfect for tall buildings, big landscapes, 
                    or even fun creative shots like standing super close to an object and letting the background stretch behind it.  
                    (Try this with a car, your shoes, or even your dog — it instantly looks dramatic.)

                  text: `When comparing an iPhone camera to DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, the main differences lie in sensor size, lens versatility, 
                  and manual control. DSLRs and mirrorless cameras have larger sensors, which capture more light and detail, producing higher quality images especially in low light. They also allow you to swap lenses for different perspectives and styles. In contrast, the iPhone camera has a small built-in sensor but uses computational photography to compensate for its size. It’s lighter, more portable, and always with you, making it convenient for everyday shooting. While you can’t change lenses manually, features like Portrait mode simulate depth-of-field effects, and Night mode improves low-light shots automatically. Understanding these differences helps you know when to rely on your iPhone versus a dedicated camera. 

Summary: iPhone cameras are portable and smart, while DSLRs and mirrorless cameras offer more control and image quality. Know the strengths of each for the best results.`,
